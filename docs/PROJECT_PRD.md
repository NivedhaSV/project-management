## User Journeys

### 1. New User Onboarding
1. User accesses login page
2. Authenticates with email/password
3. Redirected to dashboard with welcome message
4. Views project overview and quick links
5. Creates first project or joins existing team

### 2. Project Manager Workflow
1. Creates new project with description
2. Sets up project structure and team members
3. Creates user stories for project requirements
4. Breaks down user stories into actionable tasks
5. Assigns tasks to team members
6. Monitors progress through dashboard and reports

### 3. Developer Workflow
1. Views assigned tasks on "My Tasks" page
2. Accesses project Kanban board
3. Moves tasks through workflow stages
4. Reports bugs when discovered
5. Updates task status and progress
6. Collaborates through task comments (future feature)

### 4. Bug Tracking Workflow
1. User discovers and reports bug
2. Bug is categorized by severity and assigned
3. Developer investigates and updates status
4. Bug is resolved and marked as closed
5. Resolution is verified and documented

## Core Business Logic

### 1. Task Status Management
- **States**: todo → inprogress → review → done
- **Rules**: Tasks can move between states based on workflow
- **Validation**: Status transitions follow defined business rules

### 2. Priority System
- **Levels**: Low, Medium, High (Critical for bugs)
- **Impact**: Affects task ordering and assignment priority
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded badges and indicators

### 3. Project Ownership & Permissions
- **Roles**: Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer (defined but not fully implemented)
- **Access Control**: Project-based permissions system
- **Inheritance**: Team members inherit project access

### 4. Data Relationships
- Projects contain User Stories and Tasks
- User Stories can be broken down into multiple Tasks
- Bugs can be linked to specific Tasks or User Stories
- Users can be assigned to multiple Projects and Tasks

## Key Data Entities

### 1. User
- id: string
- email: string
- name: string
- avatarUrl: string

### 2. Project
```typescript
interface Project {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  ownerId: string;
  members?: ProjectMember[];
}
```

### 3. Task
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  userStoryId?: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;

```

### 4. User Story

## Data Relationships

### 1. Client Relationships
```typescript
Client → has many Projects
Client → has many Sprints
Sprint → has many User Stories (from any Project)
User Story → belongs to Sprint + Project
Task → belongs to User Story (inherits sprint & project)
```

### 2. Project Relationships
```typescript
Project → belongs to Client
Project → has many User Stories
Project → has many Tasks (through User Stories)
Project → has many Team Members
```

### 3. Sprint Relationships
```typescript
Sprint → belongs to Client
Sprint → has many User Stories
Sprint → inherits Tasks from User Stories
```

## Core Business Logic

### 1. Client Management
- Clients can have multiple projects and sprints
- Client-level sprint management across projects
- Client-specific member management

### 2. Project Management
- Projects must belong to a client
- Projects contain user stories and tasks
- Project-level permission system

### 3. Sprint Management
- Sprints are organized at the client level
- Can contain stories from multiple projects
- Track velocity and capacity

### 4. Task Management
- Tasks belong to user stories
- Inherit project and sprint context
- Status workflow management

## Key Data Entities

### 1. Client
```typescript
interface Client {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### 2. Project
```typescript
interface Project {
  id: string;
  clientId: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  ownerId: string;
  members?: ProjectMember[];
}
```

### 3. Sprint
```typescript
interface Sprint {
  id: string;
  clientId: string;
  name: string;
  status: SprintStatus;
  startDate: string;
  endDate: string;
  userStoryIds: string[];
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 4. User
- id: string
- email: string
- name: string
- avatarUrl: string

### 5. Task
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  userStoryId?: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  status: TaskStatus;
  priority: TaskPriority;
  assigneeId?: string;
  reporterId: string;

  title: string;
  description?: string;
  status: 'todo' | 'inprogress' | 'done';
  priority: TaskPriority;
  reporterId: string;
  assigneeId?: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  tasks?: Task[];
}
```
